# java-windows-activator
Simple Windows 10 Activator written in Java

The Program changes your windows activation servers to kms8 then inputs one of the pre-introduced 
keys based on the option you choose (the script asks for the windows version that you have)

This is only a test project and should not be used as a replacement for a real windows activation.
